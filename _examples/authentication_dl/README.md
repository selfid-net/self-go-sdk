# Deep link based information request

Your app can request certain bits of information to your connected users via Deep Link. To do this, you'll only need its _SelfID_ and the fields you want to request.

As part of this process, you have to share the generated deep link code with your users, and wait for a response

## Running this example

In order to run this example, you must have a valid app id and private key. Self credentials are issued by the [Self Developer portal](https://developer.selfid.net/) when you create a new app.

Once you have your valid `SELF_APP_ID` and `SELF_APP_SECRET` you can run this example with:

```bash
$ SELF_APP_ID=XXXXX SELF_APP_SECRET=XXXXXXXX go run authentication.go
```

Running this command will open the qr code in a browser, which you will need to scan with the self app on your device.

## Process diagram

This diagram shows how does a Deep link based information request process works internally.

1. Generate Self information request Deep Link
2. Share generated Deep Link code with your user
3. The user clicks the deep link
4. The user will select the requested facts and accept sharing them with you.
5. The user’s device will send back a signed response with specific facts
6. Self SDK verifies the response has been signed by the user based on its public keys.
7. Self SDK verifies each fact is signed by the user / app specified on each fact.
8. Your app gets a verified response with a list of requested verified facts.
