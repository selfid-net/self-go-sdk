# Self - Authenticate Example

This application demonstrates how to use Self Authenticate.

In this example we use websockets for communication between the browser and application. This isn't a requirement so feel free to replace this with whatever best fits your usecase.

## Usage

Run the example application.
```
cd examples/authentication
APP_ID=<SELF-APP-ID> APP_KEY=<SELF-APP-KEY> go run *.go
```

The application should now be available at http://localhost:4000.
